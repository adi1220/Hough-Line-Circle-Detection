# Hough-Line-Circle-Detection
Probabilistic Hough transform is used for Edge and Line Detection

### line detection 
for line detection opencv's (HoughLinesP()) feature is used with parameters [edges,rho,thetha,threshold,np.array([]),min_line_length,min_line_gap]

### circle detection
for circle detection opencv's (HoughCircle()) feature is used with parameters [gray_image, cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT, minDist,param1,param2,minRadius,maxRadius]
